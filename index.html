                    successful than me.
                    I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me. Romney ― I have a
                    Gucci store that's
                    worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know
                    it! Please don't
                    feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.</p>

                    other bureaucracy, but
                    program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98%
                    students gave
                    positive reviews while studying, however some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against

                    after the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle that...</p>

                    from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it for a lot of cash in

                    pay $200K
                    initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich). That
                    year I also opened
                    a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another Trump!</p>

                  <p>I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's play schedule and
                    filed an antitrust
                    lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good now, but back then they

                  <p>Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented Polish
                    workers to demolish
                    the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make architectural critic
                    Paul Goldberger
                    say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in
                    New York in some
                    years". At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and
                    completed the work in
                    three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
